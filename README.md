# MARK Portage Fork

This repository is based on the Gentoo/Zmedico repository of the Portage software with Daniel Robbins
patches starting from commit [261f0f763888d9392927a6cae2af50292fc694a1](https://github.com/zmedico/portage/commit/261f0f763888d9392927a6cae2af50292fc694a1) that is no more attached to a live branch.
For this reason, I can't push the real authors history of the commits. Really, I'm sorry about this. If
anyone still have the commits history feel free to concact me in order to push the history correctly.

We have created this fork in order to slowly work on a Portage based solution with patterns more
aligned to the MARK targets and later replace this engine with another tool in the next future.

We always thanks all the authors of the Gentoo Portage that in the history have permitted to reach
today the creation of the MARK tree.
